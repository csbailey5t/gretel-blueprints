"Rick/Mark: As discussed with you yesterday, the Enron Credit book has exposure to industries which have been negatively impacted by the events of last week.
Credit spreads have widened out in most sectors that demonstrate liquidity and remain unchanged in markets that have yet to find liquidity.
The Enron Credit book is net long protection/short risk which should be beneficial to P/L in the short-term, but there is significant default risk remaining in the book.
The exposures quoted below are gross notional exposures.
There will likely be significant recovery in the event of a default.
The primary risk is in the following sectors:  Airlines AMR Corp/Del	- Short $10MM protection Boeing Co. - Long $20MM protection British Airways Plc - Short $3MM protection Delta Airlines - Short $30MM protection Deutsche Lufthansa AG - Long $17MM protection Quantas Airways Ltd - Short $10MM protection Southwest Airlines - Net flat  The positions that we are concerned about are Delta and AMR.
Continental has announced that it may miss an interest payment early next week.
Insurance/Reinsurance Axa - Short $10MM protection; short $5mm bonds; net short $5mm protection Conseco Inc. - Short $5MM protection; short $4mm bonds; net short $1mm protection  Additionally, we have mark-to-market counterparty credit exposure of $5.7mm to CNA, $5.8mm to Ace, 10.7mm to FSL,$3.6mm to MBIA, $10 mm to Mitsui.
Reserves have been taken for all counterparty exposure.
The biggest concern here is CNA.
Lodging/Leisure Carnival Corp. - short $20MM protection Hilton Hotels Corp. - Short $25MM protection  Many of the short positions are in the insurance portfolios where we have purchased  2nd loss protection  and retain the 1st loss.
Please let me know if you need additional information.

",AGA Report 12/19
"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  Mike Peterson asked me to send you the following note, with attached order:  Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief (including a freeze of defendants' ""insider trading proceeds"") - i.e., the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month.
You probably recall that at the end of the hearing, Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief, and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December 15 and December 21.
In the attached Order, Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority, but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendant's proceeds from the sale of Enron stock.
You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Court's opinion: (a) at several places, the Court clearly indicates that any ""freeze"" or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant; and (b) the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult ""tracing"" requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze (i.e., ""trace"" a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade).
The aspects of the Court's opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are (a) the discussion of ""an equitable accounting,"" wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October 1998 and November 2001; and (b) providing an opportunity (through January 23) for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants, ""particularly as to .

"The model review meeting on Thursday went well, and the consensus was that = there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model.
= Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant co= mpanies.
Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An= dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele= ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review.
Withdrawn partner= s agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11= /27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=  scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01.
The data from economic/toll model will=  be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN= GTC intends to have by 12/20/01.
Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow=  and COS model and prepare comments.
Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM= Btu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, = and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a= ll the appropriate revisions are made.
The following are the main discussio= n points of the meeting.
Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp= act on the toll.
1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=  0% escalation).
For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5= % Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20.
Numbers such as 1.5% f= or Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=  need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates.
Do you have any op= inion on this, Bryan?
2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati= on) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=  underestimating Cost of Service.
Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w= ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed = by IRS and FERC.
Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No= rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer= ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation.
Fo= othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis= ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca= sh flow model.
They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service = model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr= ying to lower the toll as much as they can.
Tim was also concerned about le= velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat= er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this.
Please correc= t me if I am wrong here, Tim.
3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo= w (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx.
1.5% of total = Capex).
4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be = added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary.
Success fee=  of $40 million should be included in the project budget.
5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost.
The Line Pack cost (1= 4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but=  some participants highly doubted that that would be the case.
The Line Pac= k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l= east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year= s.  6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin= g 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept.
However, the current drawdo= wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin= g, which will not be true.
Certain assumptions should be made on the financ= ial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c= alculate AFUDC more accurately.
7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba= lloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6.
In reality, the initial bank loans will=  be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b= e unavoidable.
It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches=  with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=20  8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t= he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope= rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars.
A mechanis to mitigate currenc= y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.
9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con= struction period should be added.
Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c= urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi= ng IDC and AFUDC.
Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la= rger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email.

The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options 2.
CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power  transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps,  swing swaps and options 3.

They have a really old form of  agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial  transactions.

"Mark nothing has changed since our meeting last week, but here's a quick summary for your convenience:   1.
Deliberation 15: COMAE (board for ASMAE, which acts as the clearinghouse for the MAE) issued Deliberation 15 directing ASMAE to do its accounting without applying Annex V by Oct. 31, 2001.
The generators object because without Annex V,  they are 20% short instead 5% short.
Elektro and the LDCs object because failure to apply Annex V ignores the contract which is registered with the MAE, and a 20% long position will never be upheld.
Deliberation 15 further directs ASMAE to gather and supply to the generators and LDCs the information for application of Annex V, seven days prior to Oct 31.
This is good because it gives Elektro the information it needs to calculate the set off against the generators for its 5% long position.
Thus, it is unnecessary for Elektro to seek an injunction against ASMAE compelling the information.
2.
Letter to COMAE/ASMAE:  To preserve its position, Elektro sent a letter objecting to the COMAE's failure to direct ASMAE to apply Annex V.  The letter confirms a list of information LDCs require for the calculation.
If the information is not provided or is delayed, Elektro will go to court to compel the information.
Once it gets the information, Elektro can go to court  to force ASMAE to apply Annex V.  Prior to taking the set off, Elektro will seek an injunction to protect its assets from seizure by the generators under Annex VI.
Subsequently, Elektro will file a suit against the generators to enforce the contractual application of Annex V.  3.
Two suits are being filed immediately to compel ANEEL to permit Elektro to recover or pass through various costs increases pursuant to its concession agreement.
